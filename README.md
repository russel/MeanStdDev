# MeanStdDev

Mean and standard deviation calculations using many techniques in many languages.

Some of the codes are to calculate the mean and standard deviation of a finite data set. These codes each
produce a single result.

Some of the codes deal with infinite data sets and calculate either the cumulative mean and standard
deviation, or a running mean and standard deviation with some window size. These codes produce an infinite
sequence of results. Obviously (!) these codes can also deal with a finite data set â€“ especially useful for
testing.
